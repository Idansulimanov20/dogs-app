# Dog App

A full-stack application built with **Vite**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. The Dog App allows users to view pictures of dogs, like their favorite dogs, and give them names. It also has user authentication and more features like local storage, routing, and hooks.

## Features

- User authentication with sign-up, login, and logout.
- Users can view dog pictures fetched from an API.
- Users can like their favorite dogs and give them a name.
- Dog breeds and details can be viewed by clicking on each dog.
- Frontend built with React, using hooks, `react-router-dom`, and local storage.
- Backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (using Mongoose).
- API integration to fetch dog pictures.
- Responsive layout for various devices.

## Demo

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling state.
- **Vite**: For fast development and bundling.
- **react-router-dom**: For routing between different pages.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects.
- **LocalStorage**: For storing user session data.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to fetch dog images.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the frontend.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: For handling HTTP requests and building the API.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data and dog information.
- **Mongoose**: For interacting with MongoDB and managing data models.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-app.git
```

### 2. Setup Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB):
- Navigate into the backend folder:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:
  ```
  MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
  JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
  ```
- Start the server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### 3. Setup Frontend (Vite + React):
- Navigate into the frontend folder:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### 4. Open the app:
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the Dog App.

## Code Explanation

- **Backend (`/backend`)**:
  - **server.js**: The main Express server file that sets up the routes and connects to MongoDB.
  - **models**: Mongoose models for User and Dog data.
  - **routes**: API routes for user authentication, fetching dogs, and liking them.
  
- **Frontend (`/frontend/src`)**:
  - **components**: Contains all the React components like Navbar, DogCard, UserProfile, etc.
  - **hooks**: Custom hooks to manage state and API calls.
  - **App.jsx**: The main component that integrates all views and routes.
  - **utils**: Functions for API calls and other utility logic.
  - **index.css**: Styling for the app.

## Features Breakdown

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration via JWT tokens. Users can log in, sign up, and access their favorite dogs.
- **Dog Pictures**: Fetch dog images from an external API and display them on the frontend. Users can click to see more details.
- **Like & Name Dogs**: Users can like a dog and assign it a custom name. These interactions are saved in the backend.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` is used for routing between pages like Home, Profile, and Dog Details.
- **Local Storage**: Store user session data locally to keep the user logged in even after page refresh.
